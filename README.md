## 3. Getting Started

### Step 1: Team Registration & GitHub Repository Setup
1. Create a new GitHub repository for your team's project.
2. Fill in `metadata/team.yaml` with your assigned Team ID, team name, your newly created GitHub repository URL (`team.repository`), and all 2 or 4 member details.

### Step 2: AI Agent Onboarding
When you open this repository in an AI coding assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.):
- The agent will read `AGENTS.md`, greet your team, recite the competition ground rules, display the remaining time until **October 6, 2026, 11:00 AM IST**, and collect your `I agree` confirmation.
- Once confirmed, the agent records your team details and GitHub repository URL, and configures your Git remote origin.
- The agent will **automatically log every prompt, the full agent response, the Git commit SHA, exact file changes, and timeline** in `docs/logs.txt` as you build.

### Step 3: Build & Ship with Continuous Push
- Author your application code inside `src/`.
- After each prompt, changes are committed with the exact commit SHA recorded in `docs/logs.txt`, and can be pushed directly to your team's GitHub repository (`git push origin main`).
- Document your technical approach in `docs/APPROACH.md`.
- Deploy your application and record live details in `deployment/README.md`.
- Update `metadata/submission.yaml` with your final commit SHA before the **October 6, 2026, 11:00 AM IST** deadline.

## 4. Multi-Device Team Collaboration

All 4 team members can work simultaneously across separate laptops:

1. **Clone**: Every teammate clones your team's GitHub repository to their device.
2. **Syncing Progress**:
   - When one teammate finishes a feature or prompt:
     ```bash
     git add src/ docs/
     git commit -m "feat: implement feature description"
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Other teammates pull the latest updates:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```
3. **Agent Continuity**: When a teammate opens the updated repo on their laptop, their AI assistant automatically reads `docs/APPROACH.md` and recent `docs/logs.txt` entries, immediately picking up where the team left off.
